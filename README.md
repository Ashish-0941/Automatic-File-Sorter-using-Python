This project is a simple yet effective **Python automation tool** that organizes files in a directory into separate folders based on their file types.

- Automatically creates folders if they do not exist
- Sorts files into:

## 📌 How It Works
1. The script scans the target directory.
2. Checks for specific file extensions (`.csv`, `.txt`, `.png`).
3. Creates folders if they are missing.
4. Moves files into their respective folders automatically.
